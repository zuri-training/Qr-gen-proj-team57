Introduction to QR codes
A Qr code is a 2-D square-shaped black and white bar code that can be read by smartphones. QR codes store information that can be used to make a call, send a message/email, open a website or even redirect a location.

A QR Code can store up to 4296 characters or 7089 digits in a single code thus making it viable to hold large amounts of content. An active QR Code is one that a QR Code scanner is able to scan easily, prompting users to click on an external link upon scanning. The external link delivers relevant information that the user is looking for such as restaurants menu, users portfolio, customers virtual card and voting information.

Show a Welcome Message – These QR Codes encode text and the message is shown instantly to the user when they scan the code.
Virtual Business Cards – This allows one to share his/her contact details and business details on the go. It allows for easy transmission straight into the input fields of phones.

No, QR codes do not have an expiration date. The QR code has a Quick Link behind it.
As long as the Quick Link is active, the QR code will continue to work.

How much text can a QR code hold?
