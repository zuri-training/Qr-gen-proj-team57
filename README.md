###### Introduction to QR codes
* A Qr code is a 2-D square-shaped black and white bar code that can be read by smartphones. QR codes store information that can be used to make a call, send a message/email, open a website or even redirect a location.

* A QR Code can store up to 4296 characters or 7089 digits in a single code thus making it viable to hold large amounts of content. An active QR Code is one that a QR Code scanner is able to scan easily, prompting users to click on an external link upon scanning. The external link delivers relevant information that the user is looking for such as restaurants menu, users portfolio, customers virtual card and voting information.

* What can QR codes be used for?
> * URL – This feature converts a URL into a QR code.
> * WiFi Credentials – Using this feature, there’s no need to type passwords as you can connect directly to the internet by simply scanning the QR code.
> * App  – App Store QR codes are QR codes that redirect users to an app to download your app right away. This will redirect users to different URLs based on their smartphone operating software (Android OS or Apple’s iOS)

> * Show a Welcome Message – These QR Codes encode text and the message is shown instantly to the user when they scan the code.
> * Virtual Business Cards – This allows one to share his/her contact details and business details on the go. It allows for easy transmission straight into the input fields of phones.
