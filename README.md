## Acknowledgements
Special appreciation to Zuri Team and I4G for giving every
participant of team 57 the privilege to acquire more
knowlegde, and to put into practice all that has been impacted
in the course of the programme.

## Project Description
This project require building a web site for generating
a QR code (Quick Response) where user that visit the site
can only generate the code after registration. The code
generated should also to be able to be used online and offline
and can be shared through email, can also be downloaded in PNG
and PDF format.

## Problem statement
With technological evolvement, immediate access to service
using an encrypted method has been evolving over the
years, platform for the creating of this encryption is
what we will be developing.

## Questions and Answers

#### What is a QR code?
> A Qr code is a 2-D square-shaped black and white bar code
that can be read by smartphones. QR codes store
information that can be used to make a call, send a
message/email, open a website or even redirect a location.

> A QR Code can store up to 4296 characters or 7089 digits in
a single code thus making it viable to hold large amounts of
content. An active QR Code is one that a QR Code scanner is
able to scan easily, prompting users to click on an external
link upon scanning. The external link delivers relevant
information that the user is looking for such as restaurants
menu, users portfolio, customers virtual card and voting
information.
